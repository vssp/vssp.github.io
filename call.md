# Call for Applications

## [GI Dagstuhl Seminar on "Visualizing Systems and Software Performance"](https://vssp.github.io/)

July 9-13, 2018
Schloss Dagstuhl, Wadern, Germany


Application deadline: December 15, 2017

Young researchers (students through assistant-professor level, PhD in 2010 or later) working on performance engineering, software visualization or high-performance computing, are invited to apply for participation in the GI-Dagstuhl seminar on “Visualizing Systems and Software Performance (VSSP)”. VSSP will take place from July 9 until July 13 (Mon-Fri), 2018, in Dagstuhl, Germany. Schloss Dagstuhl – Leibniz Center for Informatics is a castle situated at the scenic countryside of Saarland. It is a world-renowned meeting place for computer scientists. 

The seminar addresses the problem of visualizing large-scale performance data. Visualization of large-scale performance data is a topic that is studied by the performance engineering, software visualization, and high-performance computing communities. However, these research communities are mostly disjoint and mutually beneficial knowledge is rarely shared between them. In addition, the development of a new visualization technique is an iterative process, which requires continual back-and-forth feedback between visualization and performance researchers (or practitioners) to evaluate the applicability of the technique to a real-world problem. The gap between research communities hinders the evaluation of new techniques. The main goal of the GI seminar is to bring together young researchers (PhD students, postdocs or assistant professors) in the areas of (i) performance engineering, (ii) software visualization, and (iii) high-performance computing. Each field will present their current research efforts, and exchange experience and expertise, to discuss research challenges, and to develop ideas for future collaborations.

The seminar will be divided into two parts: (i) The first two days of the seminar will focus on getting up to speed with the newest work in the different research areas and (ii) the last three days of the seminar will be used to bootstrap collaborations by working on concrete topics in small breakout groups. During the first part of the seminar, the participants will give a short (5-10 minutes) presentation about their research interests and latest work. In addition, we will have spots for (1-hour) tutorials given by the participants. These tutorials will allow the participants to go in more depth and get hands-on experience with the latest performance engineering or visualization techniques and tools. We expect these tutorials will inform the bootstrap collaborations, giving participants the background necessary to incorporate real data into the breakout sessions.

GI-Dagstuhl Seminars are sponsored by the Gesellschaft für Informatik e.V. Accommodation and full board is 50 EUR per person and day (250 EUR total), excluding travel to Dagstuhl.

Applications to the seminar will be collected via Easychair 
([https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vssp2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=vssp2018))

Applications are evaluated by the organizers of the seminar. To apply, please upload a single PDF file containing:

1. A short (max. 1 page) cover letter addressing why you think you will
    benefit from participation in the seminar and how your
    participation will benefit the seminar. Specifically address prior
    work relevant to the topic of the seminars in addition to plans for
    future research.

2. A maximum of 10 references of previous relevant projects, publications and experiences.

3. A current academic CV including current position and affiliation, a
    full publication list, and optionally a link to an online profile
    (e.g., DBLP, Google Scholar).

Please note that GI Dagstuhl seminars specifically cater to young researchers (later-stage graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and assistant professors). Hence, we limited the PhD date to 2010 or later. Application selection will favor young researchers. If you are in doubt whether you still qualify, please contact the organizers per email prior to  applying.

The deadline for applications is Dec 15, 2017. Notifications will be sent out on or before January 15, 2018.
