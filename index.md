# Visualizing Systems and Software Performance 2018 (VSSP '18)

This GI-Dagstuhl seminar addresses the problem of visualizing performance-related data of systems and the software that they run. Due to the scale of performance-related data and the open-ended nature of analyzing it, visualization is often the only feasible way to comprehend, improve, and debug the performance behavior of systems. The rise of cloud and big data systems, and the rapidly growing scale of the performance-related data that they generate, have led to an increased need for visualization of such data. However, the research communities behind data visualization, performance engineering, and high-performance computing are largely disjunct. The goal of this seminar is to bring together young researchers from these research areas to identify cross-community collaboration and to set the path for long-lasting collaborations towards rich and effective visualizations of performance-related data.

The main goal of the VSSP '18 GI seminar is to bring together yound researchers (PhD students, postdocs, or assistant professors) in the areas of (i) performance engineers, (ii) software visualization, and (iii) high-performance computing.:
- The seminar shall provide a joint forum for participants coming from different, mostly disconnected research communities.
- The participants shall learn about the latest developments in their own as well as adjacent research areas.
- The seminar shall foster interaction among the par- ticipants and establish collaborations between the re- searchers towards joint research projects.

VSSP '18 will take place from July 8 until July 13, 2018, in Dagstuhl, Germany. VSSP '18 is listed on the Dagstuhl [website](http://www.dagstuhl.de/no_cache/en/program/calendar/evhp/?semnr=18283).
